# Intro
In this project with just frontend I tried to redesign a already existing webbsite homepage which in this case I tried to redesign a homepage of a website called Schoolsoft. It's a school website that provides schoolinformation such as news, your school schedule, today's lunch, your grades etc.

## Navigaition bar 

The main schoolsoft's navbar is vertically structured at the left side of the homepage and it contains dropdown buttons with each category. Some buttons have categories that contains
only one link.

In my redesign I made the navigation bar horizontally and moved some of the links from the categories with one link only to other categories that were more relatable depending on the name of the category.

## Main content of the homepage

In my redesign, contains five different boxes were four of them are at the side while the fifth is in the middle. The four boxes at the side are suppossed to be clickable cards that 
takes you to the most importent or most searched pages which in this case I choose schedule, lunch, news and grades. When you click one of the cards it's supposed to show the 
information in the middle box of the homepage.
